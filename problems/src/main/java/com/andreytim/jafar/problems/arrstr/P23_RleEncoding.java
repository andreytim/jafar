 * RLE - encode successive repeated characters by the repetition count and the character.
 * Examples: "aaaabcccaa" => "4a1b3c2a", "3e4f2e" => "eeeffffee".
 * Implement run-length encoding and decoding functions.
 * Assume the string to be encoded consists of letters of the alphabet,
 * with no digits, and the string to be encoded is a valid encoding.
