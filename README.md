JAFAR
=====

The name is an acronym from Just Another Framework of Algorithmic Reminiscences.

Basically, this project is the consolidation of all algorithmic stuff I supposed to do in a single well organized place.

In general, I used to code in Java so everything will hopefully stay within JVM.

Main goals of this project in the order of descending priority to myself:

* to provide optimized and easy-to-use implementations of collections
* to provide easy, brief, fast and usable implementations for popular algorithms
* to provide benchmarks and compare different algorithms through them
* to help myself and others with studying algorithms
* to provide solutions for popular problems

That's only a dreamy sunny plan and currently I am working on the three modules: 
* **prim** - primitive collections submodule
* **bm** - submodule of benchmarking the whole evil I used to produce
* **algo** - submodule of various algorithms

In conclusion, all this thing is just for **fun**!

Cheers!
