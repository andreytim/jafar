**Important note:** There's nothing really useful here so far. So if you're looking for the solution or things like that then feel free to just pass by. And come back in a couple of months.

The name is an acronym from Just Another Framework of Algorithmic Reminiscences.

I could put a lot of nice words here but basically this project is just the consolidation of all algorithmic stuff I supposed to do in a single well organized place.

In general, I used to code in Java so all this adventure will hopefully stay within JVM.

Main goals:
* to provide optimized and easy-to-use implementations of collections
* to help myself and others with studying algorithms
* to provide solutions for popular problems
* to provide benchmarks and compare different algorithms through them
* to provide easy, brief, fast and usable implementations for popular algorithms

This is only a dreamy sunny plan and currently I am working on the first and the fourth bullets from the list above: 
* **prim** - primitive collections submodule
* **bm** - submodule of benchmarking the whole evil I used to produce

In conclusion, all this thing is just for **fun**!

Cheers!
