JAFAR
=====

The name is an acronym from Just Another Framework of Algorithmic Reminiscences.

I could put a lot of nice words here but basically this project is just the consolidation of all algorithmic stuff I supposed to do in a single well organized place.

In general, I used to code in Java so all this adventure will hopefully stay within JVM.

Main goals:
* to provide optimized and easy-to-use implementations of collections
* to help myself and others with studying algorithms
* to provide solutions for popular problems
* to provide benchmarks and visually compare different algorithms 
* to provide easy, brief, fast and usable implementations for popular algorithms

This is only a plan and currently I am working on the first and the fourth bullets from the list above: 
* **prim** (primitive collections) 
* **bm** (benchmarking)
